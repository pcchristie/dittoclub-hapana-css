This repo contains 3 files:
1. This context document
2. hapana-style.css which is a stylesheet for a website
3. Documentation from Hapana's website.

Hapana is a Studio Management Software which provides an embed widget which I have embedded into my Squarespace website to allow clients to purchase & book classes on our studio website. 

The default embed is styled using Hapana's styling which does not match the rest of my site. 

hapana-style.css is hosted on a Github repo which both my Hapana back-end and my Squarespace site link to. I am modifying it to ensure the embed matches the rest of my site.
