Advanced Custom CSS
The customizable elements in the widgets have the following pattern:

 

Mui-<name>-OFS-<secondName>

 

If the element or particular attribute you wish to modify is not provided in the general listing, you can identify the element using the following method.

Inspect the running widget with DevTools (how to inspect elements)
Select the desired part of the widget, as the picture below


 

In the picture, Mui-packageCard-OFS-card is defined in the class of the div inspected. Note that class has multiple classes separated by space ( ).

Looking the picture, you can see in Styles all the css properties assigned to each class.
Create a CSS file using these class names with pattern Mui-<a>-OFS-<b>.
Upload the CSS file to be accessible via URL.
 

Important Note
The classes with name jss<number> for example jss123, are generated dynamically for each release of the embed widgets, which makes them not reliable to give a custom style to your widget.

 

Thus, you should not customize these classes directly. Instead, use the class of the parent element to override its children.



 

In the above picture, in order to style the element <div class="MuiBox-root jss7"> , we should style its parent <div class="MuiDialogActions-root Mui-loginModal-OFS-dialogActions">.

For Example:

.Mui-loginModal-OFS-dialogActions > div {
  margin: 8px auto;
  padding: 4px;
  border: 1px solid dodgerblue;
}
